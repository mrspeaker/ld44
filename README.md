## POST MORTEM

Nope, didn't make it! Started something, but didn't go all in. To "play"... click on a tree, it will chop down and you get a coin. Click on another tree that is close to the other coin... it will start a cellular automata that takes over, and you have nothing else to do.

The code is a crazy bunch of crazy... but will be fun to refactor!

## Pre LD notes
OOOh, it's happening again. Not sure where this will go, but probably I'll be using:

* Pixi.js for rendering
* Emacs

The rest up to the gods.
