# LD44

[Test it out](https://mrspeaker.github.io/ld44/)

## POST MORTEM

Nope, didn't make it! Started something, but didn't go all in. To "play"... click on a tree, it will chop down and you get a coin. Click on another tree that is close to the other coin... it will start a cellular automata that takes over, and you have nothing else to do.

The code is a crazy bunch of crazy... but will be fun to refactor!

## Jam notes

hmm, could get something in for the jam!

TODO:

- make it take almost exactly 3 minutes.
- use tree% + time to dictate speed / $$$
- if first spread doesn't come after $4, add two coins!
- if last tree kill was > X seconds, add two coins somewhere
- teach camera pan/zoom?
- "Game over" congratulations.
- focus screen on first spread (in case moved)

- add/tweak text comments
- would be cool to force you to cut down last tree.
- music starts jolly/ditty... goes darker and horrible
- grass tile goes brown over game
- $ font gets bigger over time, pulses?


## Pre LD notes
OOOh, it's happening again. Not sure where this will go, but probably I'll be using:

* Pixi.js for rendering
* Emacs

The rest up to the gods.
